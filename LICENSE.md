# License

This project is dual-licensed under the terms of:

1. **[GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3](LICENSE.agpl)** or any later version
2. **[Hippocratic License 3.0](LICENSE.hl3)**

You may choose to use, distribute, and modify this software under the terms of either license.

## License Philosophy

As the author of this project, I encourage you to honor the spirit of both licenses, regardless of which one you formally adopt.

**The AGPL** ensures that the software remains free and open for all users, especially in networked environments. If you modify this software and provide it as a service over a network, you must make your modified source code available to users of that service.

**The Hippocratic License** ensures that the software is not used to violate fundamental human rights. It is grounded in internationally recognized human rights norms, including the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

I hope you will use this software to build things that are ethical, empowering, and socially responsible.

## Why Dual-License?

Different users have different needs:

- **If you need OSI-approved licensing** for enterprise compliance, institutional requirements, or compatibility with other open source projects, use the **AGPL v3**.

- **If you want explicit ethical commitments** built into your license terms and are comfortable with a license that is not OSI-approved, use the **Hippocratic License 3.0**.

Both licenses ensure the code remains open. Both require sharing modifications. They differ in whether ethical use restrictions are legally encoded.
