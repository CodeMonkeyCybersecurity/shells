## Core Infrastructure Components Implemented

### 1. Advanced Infrastructure Discovery System
**Location**: `pkg/infrastructure/`

- **`types.go`**: Comprehensive type definitions for all infrastructure components
- **`advanced_mapper.go`**: Main orchestrator with worker pool pattern for parallel discovery
- **`infrastructure_components.go`**: Core discovery components (DNS resolver, port scanner, SSL analyzer, CDN detector, ASN analyzer, tech detector)
- **`cloud_detectors.go`**: Cloud asset discovery with AWS detector implementation and placeholders for Azure, GCP, Cloudflare
- **`organization_correlator.go`**: Organization relationship mapping for finding subsidiaries, acquisitions, and partnerships

### 2. Enhanced Root Command Integration
**Location**: `cmd/root_enhanced_simplified.go` + `cmd/init_enhanced.go`

- Seamless integration with existing infrastructure
- Enhanced point-and-click mode that automatically discovers and tests entire attack surfaces
- 4-phase comprehensive analysis:
  1. Advanced Infrastructure Discovery
  2. Organization Context Analysis  
  3. Comprehensive Security Testing (leveraging existing scanners)
  4. Results Analysis and Reporting

## Key Features Implemented

### Advanced Infrastructure Discovery
- **7-Phase Discovery Process**:
  1. Initial target analysis
  2. DNS enumeration and subdomain discovery
  3. ASN analysis for related infrastructure
  4. Cloud asset discovery (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  5. Relationship analysis
  6. Supply chain analysis
  7. Threat intelligence collection

### Multi-Cloud Asset Discovery
- **AWS Detection**: Complete S3 bucket enumeration with sophisticated naming patterns, CloudFront distribution discovery
- **Cloud Provider Support**: Frameworks for Azure, GCP, Cloudflare detection
- **Public Access Detection**: Identifies publicly accessible cloud resources
- **Security Analysis**: SSL/TLS analysis, CDN detection, technology fingerprinting

### Organization Intelligence
- **Subsidiary Discovery**: Finds related companies and corporate structures
- **Acquisition Analysis**: Identifies recent acquisitions and mergers
- **Partnership Mapping**: Discovers technology and business partnerships
- **Supply Chain Analysis**: Maps dependencies and third-party relationships

### Asset Relationship Mapping
- **Comprehensive Asset Graph**: Tracks relationships between all discovered assets
- **Relationship Types**: DNS relationships, SSL certificate sharing, same ASN/network, CDN origins, technology sharing
- **Priority-Based Discovery**: Automatically prioritizes high-value assets

## Technical Architecture

### Worker Pool Pattern
- Configurable parallel workers (default 15)
- Context-aware cancellation
- Rate limiting to respect target infrastructure
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Caching and Performance
- Intelligent caching to avoid redundant discoveries
- Configurable discovery depth and asset limits
- Optimized for large-scale infrastructure mapping

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with existing authentication testing
- Leverages existing business logic testing framework
- Compatible with all existing scanner modules
- Enhanced organization correlation using existing correlation package

## Enhanced User Experience

### Point-and-Click Intelligence
Users can now run simple commands that automatically discover and test comprehensive attack surfaces:

```bash
# Discover and test everything related to a company
shells "Acme Corporation"

# Discover and test everything related to a domain  
shells acme.com

# Discover and test everything in an IP range
shells 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Comprehensive Reporting
- Infrastructure discovery summary with asset breakdowns
- Priority-based asset classification
- Organization context with subsidiaries and relationships
- Integration with existing results database and querying

## Configuration Options

### Discovery Configuration
- **Depth Control**: Maximum discovery depth (default: 4 levels)
- **Asset Limits**: Maximum assets to discover (default: 2000)
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts (default: 45 minutes)
- **Module Toggles**: Enable/disable specific discovery modules
- **Custom Patterns**: Custom subdomain wordlists, S3 bucket patterns, port lists

### Cloud Discovery
- **Multi-Region Support**: Tests multiple AWS regions automatically
- **Custom Patterns**: Configurable naming patterns for cloud resources
- **API Integration**: Ready for cloud provider API integration
- **Public Access Detection**: Identifies exposed cloud storage and services

## Security and Privacy

### Ethical Testing
- Respects rate limits and terms of service
- Only discovers publicly available information
- Requires explicit user authorization for scans
- No credentials or sensitive data stored

### Scope Awareness
- Integration with existing bug bounty scope management
- Automatic scope validation for discovered assets
- In-scope vs out-of-scope asset classification

## Database Integration

### Results Storage
- All discovered infrastructure stored in existing database
- Asset relationships tracked and queryable
- Historical analysis capabilities
- Integration with existing results querying system

### Query Enhancement
```bash
# Query infrastructure-specific findings
shells results query --tool infrastructure --severity high
shells results stats --tool infrastructure
shells results recent --tool cloud --limit 10
```

## Future Expansion Ready

### API Integration Points
