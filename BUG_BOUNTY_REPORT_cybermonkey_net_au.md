## 2. Security Findings

### HIGH SEVERITY

#### H-001: www Subdomain Service Unavailability
**Severity:** HIGH
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)
**CWE:** CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release)

**Description:**
The www subdomain (www.cybermonkey.net.au) returns HTTP 503 Service Unavailable, indicating a misconfiguration or service outage. This affects availability and could indicate underlying infrastructure issues.

**Evidence:**
```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.cybermonkey.net.au

HTTP/2 503
content-length: 217
content-type: text/plain
date: Sun, 09 Nov 2025 05:40:07 GMT
```

**Impact:**
- Broken subdomain affects user experience
- Potential SEO impact
- May indicate larger infrastructure problems
- Users accessing www variant cannot reach the site

**Remediation:**
1. Fix the www subdomain configuration to properly redirect to apex domain or serve content
2. Implement proper redirect (301 or 302) from www to apex domain
3. Monitor subdomain availability
4. Consider DNS-level handling if subdomain is not needed

### MEDIUM SEVERITY

#### M-001: Ghost Admin Panel Potentially Exposed
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Medium)
**CWE:** CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information)

**Description:**
Ghost CMS admin panel endpoint (`/ghost/`) is disallowed in robots.txt but may still be accessible. While this is standard Ghost CMS behavior, the admin panel should be protected with additional security measures.

**Evidence:**
```
Disallow: /ghost/
```

**Potential Attack Vectors:**
- Brute force attacks on admin login
- Exploitation of Ghost CMS vulnerabilities if not patched
- Information disclosure through admin panel
- Credential stuffing attacks

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized admin access if credentials are weak
- Potential CMS exploitation
- Information leakage

**Remediation:**
1. Implement IP whitelisting for /ghost/ endpoint
2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin accounts
3. Use Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to protect admin paths
4. Monitor and rate-limit authentication attempts
5. Keep Ghost CMS updated to latest version (currently 5.130)
6. Consider using VPN or bastion host for admin access

**Verification Steps:**
```bash
# Test admin panel accessibility
curl -I https://cybermonkey.net.au/ghost/

# Recommended: Should return 403 or require VPN/IP whitelist
```

- [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)

---

#### M-002: Missing security.txt File
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CVSS Score:** 4.0 (Medium)
**CWE:** CWE-1059 (Incomplete Documentation)

**Description:**
No security.txt file found at `/.well-known/security.txt`. This RFC 9116 standard file helps security researchers report vulnerabilities responsibly.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ curl https://cybermonkey.net.au/.well-known/security.txt
# No content returned
```

**Impact:**
- Security researchers may not know how to report vulnerabilities
- Missed opportunity for responsible disclosure
- Non-compliance with security best practices
- Potential for public disclosure instead of private reporting

**Remediation:**
Create `/.well-known/security.txt` with the following minimum fields:

```
Contact: security@cybermonkey.net.au
Expires: 2026-12-31T23:59:59.000Z
Preferred-Languages: en
Canonical: https://cybermonkey.net.au/.well-known/security.txt
Policy: https://cybermonkey.net.au/security-policy
```

**References:**
- [RFC 9116 - security.txt](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116.html)
- [securitytxt.org](https://securitytxt.org/)

---

#### M-003: Information Disclosure via Server Headers
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CVSS Score:** 3.7 (Low-Medium)
**CWE:** CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information)

**Description:**
Server response headers reveal detailed technology stack information that could aid attackers in reconnaissance.

**Evidence:**
```http
server: envoy
x-powered-by: Express
via: 1.1 Caddy
```

**Impact:**
- Reveals technology stack to attackers
- Enables targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities
- Facilitates reconnaissance phase of attacks

**Remediation:**
1. Remove or obfuscate `X-Powered-By` header
2. Configure Envoy/Caddy to use generic server header
3. Implement the following configurations:

**Express.js:**
```javascript
app.disable('x-powered-by');
```

**Caddy:**
```
header {
    -Server
}
```

**References:**
- [OWASP: Information Leakage](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Information_exposure_through_server_headers)

---

### LOW SEVERITY

#### L-001: Potential Ghost API Endpoints Exposed
**Severity:** LOW
**CVSS Score:** 3.1 (Low)
**CWE:** CWE-200 (Information Exposure)

**Description:**
Ghost CMS exposes several API endpoints by default. While necessary for functionality, these should be monitored for abuse.

**Discovered Endpoints:**
```
/ghost/api/content/
/members/api/comments/counts/
/email/
/r/
/webmentions/receive/
```

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
2. Monitor API usage for abuse patterns
3. Ensure proper authentication on sensitive endpoints
4. Use WAF rules to protect against API abuse

---

#### L-002: robots.txt Information Disclosure
**Severity:** LOW
**CVSS Score:** 2.0 (Low)
**CWE:** CWE-200 (Information Exposure)

**Description:**
robots.txt file reveals internal path structure and potentially sensitive endpoints.

**Evidence:**
```
Disallow: /ghost/
Disallow: /email/
Disallow: /members/api/comments/counts/
Disallow: /r/
Disallow: /webmentions/receive/
```

**Impact:**
- Reveals internal application structure
- Provides attack surface mapping to potential attackers

**Recommendations:**
1. Balance SEO needs with security
2. Consider using authentication instead of robots.txt for sensitive paths
3. Monitor access to disallowed paths

---

## 3. Positive Security Controls Identified

### 3.1 Strong Security Headers

**Implemented Headers:**
```http
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
x-content-type-options: nosniff
x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN
x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block
referrer-policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ HSTS with long max-age and preload
- ✅ Clickjacking protection (X-Frame-Options)
- ✅ MIME-sniffing protection
- ✅ XSS filter enabled
- ✅ Referrer policy configured

**Recommendations for Enhancement:**
```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
X-Frame-Options: DENY  (upgrade from SAMEORIGIN if no embedding needed)
```

### 3.2 Modern Protocol Support

- ✅ HTTP/2 enabled
- ✅ HTTPS enforced
- ✅ Alt-Svc header advertising HTTP/3
